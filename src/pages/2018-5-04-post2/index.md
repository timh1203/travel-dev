# "My Second Post With GatsbyJS"
## 2018-5-04

Today I read some articles about getting setup with Gatsby with Level Up Tuts. I'm comparing whether I should use Styled Components, Glamour, or JSS as my React Styling Framework. I'm more partial to Glamour at this point since the syntax looks a little bit more clear cut. I don't want to overwhelm myself at the beginning .
