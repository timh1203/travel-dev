Here‚Äôs what I learned from coding for the past year. These are observations I‚Äôve
made and think would benefit you. None of this is theoretical, I had experiences
with these topics andI‚Äôm always open to hear about other people‚Äôs thoughts too.

[Part 1](http://traveldev.net/easy-habit) was a brief review of tasks I‚Äôve accomplished since [200 days of code](https://medium.com/@timh1203/introduction-b64d03d47b39) (~January 20th) and [part 3](http://traveldev.net/extraordinary-plans) goes into my exciting plans for the rest of 2018.

If you would like to see what I did, you are welcome to check out my other
medium articles about [100 days of code](https://medium.com/@timh1203/100-days-of-code-parallels-with-el-penol-de-guatape-4f92383970cd), [200 days of code](https://medium.com/@timh1203/introduction-b64d03d47b39), or jump to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/traveldev).

## Pearl: Job hunting

I had a couple of job interviews but none of them followed through. I kept a
spreadsheet of all the jobs I have applied to as to not repeat the same
application. I went through the traditional channels like LinkedIn, Glassdoor,
Hired, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, etc. I went to meetups, events, and a hackathon. I
connected with people, grabbed business cards, and met them in person outside of
the event. I even went to an event with a panel of hiring speakers to tweak my
resume and learn job hunting tips.

<span class="figcaption_hack">My job application spreadsheet.</span>

When applying online, I looked at the qualifications and felt discouraged to see
the experiences required for the position. Sometimes, I would apply anyways.
Inevitably, I had to take a break as it felt like I was fighting an uphill
battle. Everyone keeps telling me that it is a numbers game but it seemed
unproductive at times and yielded little results. It took 1‚Äì3 hours out of my
day to look for job vacancies and apply to them with cover letters and resumes
which I felt could have been better spent learning. I think the only thing I
have not tried was contributing to open source.

I‚Äôm sharing this pearl with you because your situation might be different. I
would still push you not to give up and exhaust all your options. You should
apply when you are ready and you will know that depending on what core skills
you feel are needed for the job position you are looking for. I made a decision
when I came back from Medellin that I want to get a web developer job in the
next couple of months. Things were not working out as I expected so I‚Äôm shifting
my strategy: become so good that they can‚Äôt ignore you. More on this in [part 3](http://traveldev.net/extraordinary-plans).

## Pearl: Internships/Apprenticeships

As part of the job hunting process, I applied to a couple of different programs.
If you search for apprenticeships/internships online, there are going to be a
couple that pop up. I applied to Gaslight, Detroit Labs, Base Two, Revature,
Intrepid Pursuits, Techtonic Group, Moove-It, Nuttersons, Clutch.co, HashRocket,
Apprenti, and a couple others. There are probably more in your area too if you
do a search. I think these are really good opportunities for new Computer
Science or bootcamp grads. Even though some promoted that they will accept
students with zero experience, I think just the sheer amount of applications and
options might be biased against self-taught devs who might not have that
foundational CS core. Taking a fresh CS grad to mold and conform to their
systems might be more of what they were looking for. I don‚Äôt know and there‚Äôs no
point in dwelling on it.

The closest apprenticeship step I got in the process was a question posing if I
was willing to move out to the state where the apprenticeship was held. I
replied a couple days later only to find that the person was going to be out of
the office for the whole week. So I waited and didn‚Äôt heard nothing 1 week
later. I sent an email anyways asking about what the status of my application
was and they said they would consider me for the next cohort. Thanks for letting
me know by the way. üòÖ This wasn‚Äôt the first time either as they said they would
let me know about my application status on April 20th, can you guess if that
email came through too? You‚Äôre right and so I moved on.

<span class="figcaption_hack">This apprenticeship company failed to deliver twice.</span>

One of my twitter friends sent me a message and talked about how one
apprenticeship abuses their apprenticeship relationship into overworking
students too. This mention mixed with my experiences just soured it for me.
Having a big name and strapping suits on their students don‚Äôt make it a good
program internally, as I see it. That‚Äôs something you only find by talking to
the students already on the inside.

Relationships are two way streets and I‚Äôm interviewing you just as much as you
are interviewing me. It‚Äôs the same mindset I walked into Pharmacy School with
and I wasn‚Äôt going to switch it up now. There‚Äôs a point where your self-worth is
not worth sacrificing for the sake of it all. If I‚Äôm going to do something, I
want to do it my way and it has to be of mutual benefit. So what should you do?

<span class="figcaption_hack">Friendly warning from a Twitter friend.</span>

##Pearl: Accelerators

I came across two accelerators during my journey. One was tagged as an
accelerator for software engineers. It would take you through the last steps of
resume building, profile optimization, and interview skills including
algorithms/structures. I tried it out but I didn‚Äôt feel that it was right for
me. I failed the entrance test which required completing as many algorithms in
an hour as possible. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt do well since I haven‚Äôt learned much
about Big O Notation yet. This might be a good program for those who have a CS
background already and simply want to hone their skills.

The second accelerator was from a gentleman who was willing to guide me through
building projects. He advertises that he is one of the highly rated stack
overflow user and have been programming since early childhood and son of a
super-senior developer. I had little money during this time and didn‚Äôt feel that
the juice was worth the squeeze. Not only would it force me half of my savings
but might also force me to go work another part-time job. Nothing wrong with
that but I didn‚Äôt want to get further away from coding so I declined and
continued on my path.

## Pearl: Other skills

Don‚Äôt forget to work on your other skills such as technical and soft skills.
Even though it feels like you might be taking time away from learning, these
skills will optimize your build processes and prepare you for future interviews.
Sometimes, I would branch off and learn a new skill after completing a big app.
At first, work on the necessities like
[Git/Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123),
[command line](https://wesbos.com/command-line-video-tutorials/), dev tools,
Chrome console, and keyboard shortcuts. These really helped me increased my
productivity and picked them up by watching other coders.

<span class="figcaption_hack">One of my most favorite courses for learning Git/Github.</span>

Later, you can think about things like using Google Drive sync to back up your
code (don‚Äôt forget to delete node_modules folder). For API keys and files, I
also save it on google drive to quickly run an app since I usually delete the
whole project off my Mac anyways due to videography demands and limited HD space
(500GB). To work with api keys, learn to work with
[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and environmental variables since
it‚Äôs a great way to hide api keys from public view. Get into different softwares
to speed up your computer handle skills like with Spectacle or Alfred.

<span class="figcaption_hack">A coding group I hung out with.</span>

For soft skills, I highly recommend going to meetups! Most people area already
interested in what you‚Äôre doing if you‚Äôre going to a technology meetup anyways.
This helps you work on your pitch when you go to interview and to make new
friends. Years ago, I started out going to every meetups that interested me. I‚Äôm
a much more sociable person because of it and get comments all the time about my
‚Äúpeople skills‚Äù. Feeling confident? Go to meetups that you might NOT have gone
to in the first place. In the past, I went to some unique meetups like Reiki,
Toastmasters, rock climbing, kayaking, Salsa, and a few other esoteric ones. Are
you gushing with confidence? Become an organizer for a meetup. I did this for a
20 & 30‚Äôs social group and a Free Code Camp group. As a dev, you‚Äôre probably
spending a lot of screen-time anyways so we, as developers, need to balance it
out with people time as well. *I have never heard of a dev job opportunity
landing at your front door but I have heard of people getting them from getting
out there to events*.

## Pearl: Code and Coffee Meetup

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tln0jVpujGxIEP0Ye5GQpA.png)
<span class="figcaption_hack">[Time-lapse videos from September 23, 2017 to May 27,
2018.](https://youtu.be/nTGbwZJvwzY)</span>

One thing I glad I did was running a local Free Code Camp meetup in my area. I
met so many cool people that came through including a mid-level dev, junior
devs, bootcamp grads, self-taught Free Code campers, and other friends.
Sometimes, nobody came at all but I still went anyways and worked on my
projects. Some of these people, I ended up being good friends with. I just hung
out with 2 of these guys yesterday even if they lived an 1 hour away. It‚Äôs nice
to have to have someone talk development with in person. Chat rooms and forums
are nice but doesn‚Äôt hit the right buttons at the end of the day. Humans are
social creatures and I‚Äôm old-fashioned. Want to work on your dev skills? Why not
[make a website](https://free-code-camp-ashburn.github.io/website/) for your
code and coffee meetup? I even tried making [an RSVP system](https://github.com/timh1203/respondez-app) for my coding meetup as to
break out from Facebook. I promise you will make at least one developer friend.
I know I did and my area is very suburban.

## Pearl: Don‚Äôt underestimate physical and mental health

Your code and mental clarity is key in being a great dev. Don‚Äôt neglect your
physical health because it‚Äôs too cold outside or you‚Äôd rather spend more time on
code. Coming from a medical background, I urge you to try working standing up,
taking frequent walks and breaks, and eat green. You might not see if now but
when you‚Äôre a mid-level dev, you might thank me. Invest in a Roost stand or prop
up your table with some stools. Work outside on your deck or patio.

<span class="figcaption_hack">If you want to see my setup: you can visit

Want to perform at an even higher level? Most high level practitioners have some
kind of mindfulness ritual whether it‚Äôs meditation, yoga, swimming, working out,
etc. I do a combination of nightly meditations before bed and 1 hour walks in
the morning. They are really good times to clear your mind and decompress. If
you‚Äôd like, I recommend podcast-walking. Syntax.fm or Language Transfer are
quick ways to catch up on tech news and learn Spanish. Extra credits if you
recognize these flags. üá®üá¥üá≤üáΩ

My friend Joe also runs a sort of [meditation group](https://joeprevite.com/meditation) if you‚Äôre into that. Hit him up on
Twitter @jjprevite!

##Pearl: Think outside the box, your job & life happiness depends on it

This will be a foreshadow of [part 3](http://traveldev.net/extraordinary-plans)
but I want you to start thinking about optimizing your life too. Thinking like
Tim Ferris? Great, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed. Unlike any other jobs I‚Äôve worked
for, technology gigs are in a prime position to offer you many lifestyle design
options. The process for learning, applying to jobs, and working with
development offers you many unique opportunities that others might not have in
other industries like medical or retail.

The usual story, most students have to attend university for 2 or 4 years on
location to learn their craft and sometimes it‚Äôs just working with theories.
Besides the obvious apply and interview, tech is cool because it offers
opportunities if you might contribute to an open source project. Or accept an
apprenticeship position, paying you minimal wage to support your accommodations,
while you learn and build. After 3 months, you gain a job offer or end work with
one of their partners. Don‚Äôt have a doctorate in the field? No problem! This is
the area that I semi-regret. It took 8 years out of my life and taught me how to
learn but if I had to go back and do it again? Probably not. I can just take 6
months-18 months to gain real skills to get into the workforce earning $60‚Äì80k a
year? That‚Äôs a smart life choice.

> Let‚Äôs repeat that: $60‚Äì80k a year for less than 2 years of learning versus $100K
> for 8 years of learning. Less theory, more practical knowledge.

Get creative in all aspects of your life and see what doors open up for you.
Take advantage of your situation!
