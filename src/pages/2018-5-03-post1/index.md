# "My First Post With GatsbyJS"
## 2018-5-03

This is my first post on GatsbyJS.
I started a new project with Gatsby default starter repo. I learned how to make links, a menu bar, and write markdown files.

Some useful npm backs I learned about were:
1. gatsby-source-filesystem
2. gatsby-transformer-remark
3. gatsby-plugin-catch-links

You should know how to install npm packages and you also need to add the packages to the gatsby-config.js.

We also used graphQL to grab some of data of the blog posts based on the path set out in the "frontmatter" inside each blog post.
