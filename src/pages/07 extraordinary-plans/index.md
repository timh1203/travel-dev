Thanks for making it this far. The [first
part](http://traveldev.net/easy-habit)
of the series revealed what I‚Äôve been doing since 200 days of code and the
[second part](http://traveldev.net/developer-pearls) talked about different pearls I picked up. Part 3 will talk about my
plans for the next six months.

## Coding Schools

In the last article, I talked about internships, apprenticeships, and
accelerators. I did not touch upon bootcamps or coding schools since I never
even considered this option. Call it stubbornness/pride or what have you, but I
was convinced that I can teach myself coding. After coding for a year, I
realized how vast web development really is. *The more you learn, the deeper the
digital ocean becomes*** üòÖ**. The truth is that I feel that I have not opened
the right doors or met with the right opportunities. I didn‚Äôt have much luck
finding a junior position in my job searches and I‚Äôm burning the wick off the
time candle. So I‚Äôm deciding to commit myself to a coding school (Read: not a
bootcamp).

One, I didn‚Äôt want to waste any more time trying to find what industry standard
practices are like build processes, architecture, and team collaboration. I want
to get actual experience so I can start making money and pursue my dream of
digital nomadism/expatriotism. Two, I already got a jump start on the material
and it would only make me a more skillful developer. I suspect that I‚Äôll be able
to grasp more concepts beyond the basics so any program will offer me more
value. I‚Äôll get a chance to ask questions and learn from high level
developers/instructors. Three, whatever happens in the next six months, I know I
will come out with a job on the other side after officially ‚Äúdoing my time‚Äù.
Four, this is going to be the most exciting reason of all: being able to live in
another country while I go to this online coding school! Yes, you heard me
correctly. But let‚Äôs talk about the school first shall we?

I specifically checked out [Lambda School](https://mbsy.co/mCJSW),
[Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), and other online schools. I already
filtered out all the schools requiring up-front payment, learning on-site, or
that seemed like money was more important than my education.

## Lambda School

I talked to my friend, Juan, about my goals after June to enroll in a program if
I don‚Äôt get a dev job. He recommended I check out Lambda School since he‚Äôs heard
a lot about it. Here‚Äôs the quick breakdown:

* 100% online school with live lectures and group work
* 6 months of curriculum and learning
* No upfront tuition with income share agreement (ISA)
* Pay only after you get a job that nets $50k or more (17% for 2 years each,
maximum total cap of $30,000)
* Job preparation team to help you interview and polish your virtual image
* Mastery-based progression, brown bag lunches, company partnerships, project
managers, sprints, and etc.
* A network of new developer friends all around the world

Here‚Äôs [my video talking about Lambda
School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cFnm55zQc8) and the mini-bootcamp.
Here‚Äôs more about [the ISA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGh5-g4KR1Q) or a
day in the [life of a student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wmh3CYVu_s) from
the co-founder.

> Here‚Äôs some quick math on income share payments:<br> Salary * 17% = Annual
> payment/12mo = Monthly payments (2 yr total)

> $50,000 * 17% = $8,500 /12 = $708/mo (Total: $17,000)<br> $60,000 * 17% =
> $10,200 /12 = $850/mo (Total: $20,400)<br> $70,000 * 17% = $11,900 /12 = $992/mo
(Total: $23,800)<br> $80,000 * 17% = $13,600 /12 = $1,133/mo (Total:
$27,200)<br> $90,000 * 17% = $15,300 /12 = $1,275/mo (Total: $30,600) **30k
cap** üìà<br> $100,000 * 17% = $17,000 /12 = $1,417/mo (Total: $34,000) **30k
cap** üìà

I considered other bootcamps and schools but none of them had a solid of a
reputation as Lambda. Other bootcamps generally require upfront payment which is
expensive and a big risk in my opinion! They also require you to attend live
lectures on location which adds housing/transportation costs into the mix. This
is not to say that you won‚Äôt land a job with a bootcamp because my two good
friends found jobs here close to Washington D.C. Simply put, it‚Äôs just not
something that I can afford right now.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Part of Lambda School‚Äôs 6 month curriculum. More? See [full
curriculum](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw.html).</span>

Another strong reason that I chose Lambda was that the curriculum spans for 6
months which gives students ample time to grasp concepts and work on **depth**
as well as **breadth **of the material. Other bootcamp seems to force feed you 3
months and that‚Äôs it. Lambda‚Äôs dive into some really great techs like React,
Redux, Java, C, Node, Express, Python/Django.

There a definitely a couple more reasons I picked Lambda School but I think it‚Äôs
a pretty solid choice. I‚Äôm not out to actively promote them but I earnestly
believe it‚Äôs a great program and would love to help other folks who might be
looking for what I was looking for. If you want to know more, hit me up with
questions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/traveldev).

## Guadalajara, Mexico

You must already know but I‚Äôm a huge travel fan bordering living in countries
for months at a time. Hint: I have already lived in [Medellin for 6
months](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTS2VjPOpjU0njRf536hVFx9-7cwBtG1).
For starters, Mexico is not on the other side of the world which makes classes
and getting home back stateside quite easy and cheap ($200‚Äì300).

<span class="figcaption_hack">Can‚Äôt wait for all the food, culture, and freedom!</span>

Guadalajara is known for it‚Äôs identity as Mexico‚Äôs tech hub. It‚Äôs modern with
fast internet, amazing food, beautiful culture and similar services found
stateside. There‚Äôs Walmart, Sam‚Äôs Club, Costco, and just about anything else you
might need. My AT&T phone plan also covers unlimited text and calls with data
plans as well. [No fumbling this time with sim
cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iOr0C4V6iY) and jailbreak phones like in
Colombia. The Airbnb I‚Äôm staying at supports a 100MB connection and another one
I inquired about supports 60MB. Most places say they have a 10‚Äì20MB line. I
specifically need high speed for the classes/conferences that I would be taking
online.

Let‚Äôs not even talk about the cost of living there. Rent is as cheap as $150 and
all the way up to as high as you want. We picked a penthouse apartment for
$410/month split 2 ways with awesome amenities right nearby like 3br/2bath,
being next to Sam‚Äôs Club & a huge park, and being close to downtown. We have the
whole apartment to ourselves! Pro tip: booking for a week or a month will get
you a discount on AirBnb, sometimes by almost 40% off.

## #100 Days of Code

I had a twitter follower asked me if I was on my 358th day of coding the other
day and I proudly proclaimed he can trace the chain back all the way from June
22th, 2017. I was glad to have inspired so many people to keep coding and
learning but alas, all good things must come to an end. This 1 year journey has
given me such a die-hard coding habit that I‚Äôm extremely grateful for. People
like Scott Spence helped served an inspiration during my journey. I can‚Äôt say my
Github looks as good as [his Github](https://github.com/spences10) though. Haha.

<span class="figcaption_hack">[@ScottDevTweets](https://twitter.com/ScottDevTweets) on Twitter</span>

Even though I won‚Äôt be tweeting about my daily progress, I will still continue
to code everyday and doing some insane deep dives with Lambda School for the
next 6 months. Hopefully, I‚Äôll still have a chance to make vlog videos like I
did in the past when I traveled in Europe, Japan, and Colombia. I have some
ideas in the works for weekly videos during my time at Lambda School, a GatsbyJS
series to teach what I‚Äôve learned, and a couple other ideas.

## Conclusion

I‚Äôm super excited about this next chapter in my life. As I move out of the
100DaysOfCode space, I invite you to connect with me on any of the platforms
below. I primarily hold presence on Twitter and Youtube. If you like travel, you
might like [my blog](http://traveldev.net/). I like making new friends,
especially from other countries.

Remember that you never waste time if you‚Äôre moving forward. Sitting still and
doing nothing will not help place you in a more favorable position.
