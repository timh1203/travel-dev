        I stepped away from a full-time job in the medical industry on October 28th, 2016. I left the corporate world behind and dedicated myself to redesigning my lifestyle so I can work and travel anywhere. Although I have tried different ventures initially, I found that I love web development as an outlet to create flowing, creative art. This is my journey to create a life rich in experiences and to roam this planet among the vagabonds, digital nomads, world travelers, and lifestyle entrepreneurs. I hope my experiences will make you think about a more magnanimous life and all the beauty encompassing our beautiful sphere.

        There are many nomads that housesit, do workaways, teach English, and other jobs. There are some digital nomad coders like Chris the Freelancer or Niall Doherty that are well-known and others not so much on the grid. There’s a ton of people talking about working remotely as developers like Izzy, Breandan Beneschott and Nick McCrea. . I simply want to share my journey in web development and travels with you. Hopefully, it will inspire you to one day step out of your comfort zone and bet on yourself for once and for all. Of course, digital nomadism is not all rainbows and butterflies but that’s life. Hope to see you out in the world soon, my friends.
