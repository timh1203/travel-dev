      <H3>These are the services I like to use when I travel.</H3>

      <P>
        <A href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/19/94WOW0DVSW" target='_blank'>Chase Sapphire Reserve</A> has $300 annual travel credit, 3x points on travel/dining worldwide, 50% more on travel redemption, Complimentary Priority Pass Lounge Membership, , Global Entry/TSA Pre-check Fee Credit, and no foreign transaction fee. Without a doubt, one of the best travel cards out there.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/online-checking-account/" target='_blank'>Capital One 360 Credit or Debit Account</A> is my backup card in case of emergencies. I had both their credit and debit card and solid service every time. I every used the travel mileage I've earned and it was great!
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/get-started/checking/" target='_blank'>Charles Schwab Debit Card</A> has no foreign transaction fees and will reimburse you for foreign ATM withdrawals which I took full advantage of in Colombia. No minimum balance and a very nice card.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.worldnomads.com/" target='_blank'>World Nomads</A> was used it for my Europe, Colombia, and Japan trip and seriously one of the best traveler's insurance sites out there with really great rates. They refunded me $500 bucks when I had problems with my laptop!
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target='_blank'>AirBnB</A> was my go-to and booked them too many times to count in the states and abroad in Europe and Colombia. A lot of people use it around the world and I found some pretty great homes when I was traveling in Santa Marta, Colombia.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.uber.com/" target='_blank'>Uber</A> is a great option even I usually don't need it in South American countries. Most of the time you will take public transportation or use local taxi apps (IE EasyTaxi in Colombia). But when you're just not sure about safety or want to use your credit card, Uber is the app to use.

I've used windows for a long time but instantly fell in love with the software, operating system, and clean look. You can argue that it's pricey but you are really paying for a quality product that lasts a long time. Why the 2015? It's the best generation with usb, headphones, magsafe, and retina display. None of that gimmicky touchbar deal. Want to see my technical specs? <A href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XZGUL8W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1' target='_blank'>Amazon Posted Specs</A> | <A href='https://support.apple.com/kb/sp719?locale=en_US' target='_blank'>Apple Stock Specs</A>

Oh, helps hide that you have a Macbook when you travel to deter thieves if they don't know any better by not having that glowing Apple logo. üòâ

There are going to be a couple imitations out there for cheap but I wanted a quality product that doesn't fail on me while on the road. Very durable construction compared to others as I've read. Shell up the money and buy it once.

I've used them for working out and coding sessions. They are comfortable for a few hours but get sore after that, which is a perfect time to let you know to take them off and take a aurical break. The case charges the earbuds and supposedly lasts 12 hours with multiple charges.

It holds up to 15-inch laptop comfortably and feature a lower compartment for dirty shoes or wet items. A bit small on the size but fits my needs perfectly while still rockin that clean, slick aesthetic. Recommended for a day work packpack or a makeshift hiking backpack.

      <H2>üì≤ My Phone Tools</H2>
      <P> My second lifeline after my laptop. I recommend a sub-300 phone so you don't attract attention of pickpockets and willing to part ways if falls out of your possession.

The same goes for your phone. You want to be able to have your communications, navigation, and logistics planning powers up and running. This has helped me carry through 3-5 days when I'm traveling without having to worry about charging it all the time. It's a little bit hefty but a small price to pay for not worrying about my phone ever missing in the action.

        If you‚Äôre trying to set up a blog/website and new to web design, going with a framework might be more desirable! Get a domain name with Namecheap, host it with Bluehost, and use Divi theme to start with! Once you get more experience, you can start build your sites with GH-Pages, Heroku, Next, Now, GatsbyJS, and the list goes on.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target='_blank'>Namecheap</A> allows you to buy custom domain names which I prefer over GoDaddy. There seems to be less promotion and it‚Äôs much easier to use. There‚Äôs a dashboard to keep of all the domain names you purchase and reminds you when domains start expiring.

        <A href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=33802" target='_blank'>Divi Theme by Elegant Themes</A> is a modern solution that makes website building easy with building blocks and modules. With complete access to all themes including 87 at this point, extensive tutorial section, and unlimited website usage; it‚Äôs a phenomenal value for the price. I‚Äôve created more than 3 websites with their product and love it. Coding knowledge is NOT required but you won‚Äôt be limited if you want to use CSS either. There‚Äôs split testing, visual builder, template saver, and many other functions. Play with their demo and see if it‚Äôs a good fit for you.

        <A href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/timothyhoang/" target='_blank'>Bluehost</A> is a popular company for good reason. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use, and has excellent support. Compared to other hosting company, I‚Äôve found Bluehost offers a great deal and excellent perks. I‚Äôve already hosted six websites with them and they have not let me down yet. I would really recommend them for anyone wanting to start a new website. Consider a Plus plan if you plan on hosting many websites.

        There are a million and one coding sites out there. These are some of the free ones I recommend you start with to see what kind of coding you like to learn. Take advantage of them and try out different resources to see what works for you!
      </H3>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target='_blank'>Free Code Camp</A> is another great place to learn to code with free exercises and community. It‚Äôs considered a real school which you can list on LinkedIn and helps you get in contact with non-profits after you finish your certifications. However, many people get jobs way before they finish their certifications. Though a little vague on instruction sometimes, it‚Äôs still a great resource to get you started.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target='_blank'>Codecademy</A> is a very similar learning environment to Free Code Camp. Plenty of exercises and courses for you to sign up on. It‚Äôs free and really fun to learn. Instructions are much better but it does not have a large community to interact with others. The best way to learn is to read, apply, and see the results. This is a great place to do just that!
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.udemy.com/" target='_blank'>Udemy</A> has plenty of awesome great courses from independent instructors. I recommend Colt Steele, Stephen Grider, Anthony Alicea, Andrew Mead to get start with. There are plenty of other good instructors but those are usually some of the most highly recommended. Please do not spend $200 on the course, Udemy has sales constantly and you can get this course for $10-15 easily.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target='_blank'>The Web Developer Bootcamp </A> is my personal favorite course on Udemy with focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB. It‚Äôs taught by Colt Steele who has taught bootcamps in the past. I love the style of the course and how practical it was taught. Coding can be daunting for a beginner but the instructor knows about this and helps you feel like you‚Äôre making improvements every day. The technologies are starting with the very basics but you can start implementing ES6 (JavaScript) if you know some. Please do not spend $200 on the course, Udemy has sales constantly and you can get this course for $10-15 easily.
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://es6.io/" target='_blank'>ES6 For Everyone </A> is an awesome resource if you‚Äôre a JavaScript ninja. Get your chops down and learn all the updates that were released in 2015. Wes Bos is a great teacher and his videos are informative but do not leave you snoring. Wes covers template strings, promises, symbols, generators, proxies, and a ton more! Do yourself a favor if you doing JS, pick this up. Absolutely love this course and recommending to everyone I know!
      </P>
      <P>
        <A href="https://reactforbeginners.com/" target='_blank'>React For Beginners </A> is an awesome course to start learning React with the latest technologies, Google's Firebase, and other services as well. It's how I learned React myself and I highly recommend this instructor too. Wes is fun rolled in with high Javascript expertise which makes picking up React a great experience for newbies.
