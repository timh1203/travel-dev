          ‚ô¶Ô∏è <A href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target='_blank'>The Web Developer Bootcamp </A> is my personal favorite course on Udemy with focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and more. It‚Äôs taught by Colt Steele who has taught numerous bootcamps in the past. I most enjoyed the style and pace of the course. Coding can be daunting for a beginner but the instructor who has teaching experience can help you feel like you‚Äôre making improvements every day. The technologies are starting with the very basics and takes you to the end. Some of the syntax and libraries might be older but learning foundation syntax is not a bad thing!

Wes covers template strings, promises, symbols, generators, proxies, and a ton more! Do yourself a favor if you doing JS and pick this up.
