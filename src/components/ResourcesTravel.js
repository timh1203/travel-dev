            ♦️ <A href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/19/94WOW0DVSW" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire Reserve</A> has 3x points earnings on travel and dining, $300 annual travel credit, 50% more on travel redemption, complimentary lounge membership, global entry/TSA pre-check registration reimbursement,  25% more of travel redemption when booking through their website, and no foreign transaction fee. Without a doubt, one of the best travel cards out there. The annual fee is $450 but in reality only $150 if you account for the $300 annual travel credit.

            ♦️ <A href="https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/get-started/checking/" target="_blank">Charles Schwab Debit Card</A> has no foreign transaction fees and will reimburse you for foreign ATM withdrawals, which I took full advantage of in Colombia. No minimum balance required and a very nice card to have while traveling the world.

        ♦️ <A href="https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire Preferred</A> was the card I previously held before the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card. The card has 2x points on travel and dining, 25% more of travel redemption when booking through their website, no foreign transaction fees, annual fee waived the first year, and other trip and baggage protections. This card is a lighter on the annual fee at $75 than the Reserve card. If I couldn't have the Reserve card, I would have this one instead.

        ♦️ <A href="https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/online-checking-account/" target="_blank">Capital One 360 Credit or Debit Account</A> is my backup card in case of emergencies. I had both their credit and debit card and experienced solid service every time. With the debit services, I really enjoy not having to maintain a minimum balance and ability to deposit cash at a branch right across the street from my house. Their online systems are fantastic and you can even deposit a check via mobile. They are striving to have less of a physical location presence and it's apparent.

        ♦️ <A href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">AirBnB</A> was my go-to for quick accomodations and booked them too many times to count. I've used it in the states and abroad in Europe and Colombia. A lot of people use it around the world and I found some pretty great homes when I was traveling in Santa Marta, Colombia. I'm even using it for my next trip in Mexico and found a great top floor apartment! Excited to live there.

        ♦️ <A href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</A> is a great option for a quick ride. Most of the time I took public transportation or use local taxi apps (IE EasyTaxi in Colombia). Uber is the way to go if you don't yet have the local currency and want to pay with your credit card or you're just not sure about safety. To further increase safety, try out their new feature about notifying a friend for a trip.
