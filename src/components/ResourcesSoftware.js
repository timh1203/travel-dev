            ‚ô¶Ô∏è <A href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/1244000/386170/5618" target="_blank">Namecheap</A> allows you to buy custom domain names which I prefer over GoDaddy. There seems to be less promotional hype and it‚Äôs much easier to use. There‚Äôs a dashboard to keep of all the domain names you purchase and reminds you when domains start expiring.

No longer do you have to import your songs to your phone via a cable, just use this service over Wi-Fi instead. Use this to sync all your mp3's, audiobooks, and audio medias. Expect it to take at least an hour and more if you have a larger music collection. The basic version is a 30-day trial of the premium version with full features. The premium version is a one time purchase for $7.99 on Google Play store.
